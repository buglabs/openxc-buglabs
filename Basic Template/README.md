Introduction
============
The Basic Template provides a pre-configured set of widgets to view live data from up to four OpenXC devices on one dashboard.  Use this as a reference for building custom dashboards that display the data and sensor information in a way that suits your needs.

How to Use
============
**Note:  before using, you must have an OpenXC device configured to send data to dweet.io.  We recommend pairing an OpenXC device with the dweet.io-integreated OpenXC Enabler Android App.  See https://github.com/buglabs/openxc-buglabs/releases/tag/0.9 for further information.**

Begin by signing in to your OpenXC freeboard account, then navigate to the main dashboard link at https://openxc.freeboard.io/board/tVzyK6.  Click [Clone] to save an editable copy of the template into your account.
